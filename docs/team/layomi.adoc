== PROJECT: Efficient Learning Scheduler

---

== Overview

This is a desktop Efficient Learning Scheduler application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). It is a Java application targeting NUS School of Computing students who are interested to learn how to learn. Our efficient learning scheduler implements ALSETâ€™s proven learning strategy such as spacing. We believe that with our application at your expense, you will be able to develop a good and efficient learning habit that will help you achieve your academic or career goals.
== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add an activity to a Person's timetable*
** What it does: adds an activity to a Person's timeTable.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user needs to be able to add an activity to the timeTable.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires adding many classes in all 4 components of the application - Logic, Model, UI and Storage, thus it requires me to have a good understanding of the whole application.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a getStringTimeTable method that changes the timeTable to a 2D array of Strings.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub
** Enhancements to existing features:
